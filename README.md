# gendall-storybook-gatsby

npm i

npm run storybook

You should see a 'stories' folder which is where all storybook components recide. Each component is contained in it's own [componentName] folder and has a [componentName].js file and corresponding [componentName].stores.js file (also any other related files in the future? Styles etc if component gets large).
